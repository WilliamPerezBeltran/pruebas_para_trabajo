Given the following Active Record query, write the equivalent SQL query:

employees = Employee.joins(:departments)
                   .where(departments: { location: 'New York' })
                   .where("employees.salary > ?", 50000)
                   .order("employees.last_name ASC")
                   .select("employees.first_name, employees.last_name, departments.location")

SELECT employees.first_name, employees.last_name, departments.location
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id
WHERE departments.location = 'New York'
AND employees.salary > 50000
ORDER BY employees.last_name ASC;
