Which of the following options correctly transforms the given SQL query into Arel (Active Record) syntax to achieve the same result?
You can assume that users and orders have an Association on orders.user_id.

SELECT users.name, COUNT(orders.id) AS order_count
FROM users
JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id
WHERE orders.created_at >= '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY users.name
ORDER BY order_count DESC;
