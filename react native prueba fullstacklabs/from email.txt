Hi William,

Thanks for your interest in FullStack Labs and for completing our questionnaire. We would like to invite you to participate in our interview and testing process. We begin with a general coding assessment which will be sent to you separately. You will receive the invitation in an email from CodeSignal. Please complete the assessment within 48 hours of receipt. The assessment has a time limit of 70 minutes and cannot be paused, so please be sure you have adequate time available.

After our review of the assessment we will make a determination whether to move you forward to a first interview. We’ve attached a step-by-step summary of the hiring process, which will help you understand how our process works, and what to expect over the next couple weeks.

If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know.

Cheers!
