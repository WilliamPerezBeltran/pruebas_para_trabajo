Task: URL Shortener

A URL Shortener is a service that creates short aliases for URLs. It generates a shortcode for a URL and then redirects the user to the URL when that code is accessed. One example of such a service is https://bitly.com/.

Your task is to create a service using Python 3 that has two endpoints:

	*One accepts a URL via a POST request and returns a shortcode
	*The other one accepts a shortcode via a GET request and redirects to the original URL

You should also design and implement a simple UI that sends a URL to the first endpoint and shows the generated alias.

What we’ll be evaluating

	*You’re free to make any design decisions you consider necessary. Please use the project’s README to document those decisions and your reasoning behind them
	*We expect you to have a clean, layered architecture and clean code
	*We suggest you use a simple DB, such as SQLite; but again, you’re free to choose whatever technology you want
	*Feel free to use any framework you want
	*We want to see that you can implement a simple and clean UI (with clean markup) and connect it to a back-end service. For that reason, don’t worry too much about the visual design, you can use a 		CSS Framework to help you with that
	*The code is tested and has decent test coverage
	*Your usage of Git. Commit early and often! We want to see that you use your Git history as a means of documentation with clear commit messages. We’ll follow it to evaluate your coding process
	*You write code in a consistent, clean style, and use tools to help you with that
	*You document your app and the steps necessary to install it, run it, test it, etc.

Bonus points

	*If you use a modern JS Framework for the UI
	*If you deploy your app to a server and share the link with us
	*If that deployment is on Amazon AWS
	*You provide Docker configuration files to easily install and deploy your app
