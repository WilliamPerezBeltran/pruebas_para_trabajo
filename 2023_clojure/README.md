HelloðŸ˜€ 

This is the Dataico challenge, which involves learning about a language you might not be familiar with but is used at Dataico.ðŸš€
The first part is just learning and setting up the IDE. The second is the challenge, which is contained in the attatched zip file in this email.
When you are finished ( it normally takes about 3 days ) email us back the github/gitlab link for your repo and we will check it out. If we like the work and the tests all pass, then we will contact you for the next interview and if we hire you then you will receive a 1 million COP bonus.ðŸ’µ
Working at Dataico is unique and you will grow here as fast as you like, since we are a meritocracy, where the best ideas win, and growth is only limited by your ability. So if you are a great programmer, this is the place to be. ðŸš€
We pay up to 10K USD ðŸ’¸ per month depending on the candidateâ€™s experience and ability.  You will not start there but that is the upper range. We start you lower than expected and the salary keeps going up the more you know, learn , grow and are able to do things. This job is better suited for excellent candidates because you can move up to a much higher salary here than at other companies. Typically those who donâ€™t learn as fast and are not really good programmers can earn more at other companies though, because their standards are lower. So keep that in mind.

SETUP ðŸ¤“

1. Install Intellij (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) + Cursive Plugin  (https://cursive-ide.com/)  
2. Setup a Github Account and a deps.edn Clojure Project https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli
3. Read https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/ Part II, Chapters 3,4,5 (1 & 2 are about using Emacs so not necessary)
      - STRONG Advise: Run the code for those chapters in a REPL in Intellij (SUPER USEFUL)
4. You'll need the following for testing
     - Read https://clojure.org/guides/spec and be familiar with SPEC
     - Read https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.test/deftest
5. Once ready, see it you can solve the 3 problems in 4 - 6 hours. These problems use clojure.core functions and will be simple once you've gone through the above material.
CHALLENGE
 1. Unpack the zip file and use it to create a github or gitlab repo.  The challenge is explained in the README.  Then when you are done, send us the link to your repo.  

Enjoy the challenge and I look forward to seeing your results.

Keep in mind that you have a maximum period of 5 days to respond to the test. Thank you very much for your availability
