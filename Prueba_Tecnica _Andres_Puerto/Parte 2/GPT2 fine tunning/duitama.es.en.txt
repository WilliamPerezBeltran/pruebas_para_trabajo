Duitama is a Colombian municipality, located in the department of Boyacá, in central-eastern Colombia, in the Alto Chicamocha region. It is the capital and largest urban center in the province of Tundama. It is known as "The Civic Capital of Boyacá" and "The Pearl of Boyacá". It is the most important land transportation port in eastern Colombia, located on several of the main roads in the region, including the North Central Trunk Highway, which makes it a strategic point for the provision of services and the development of industrial activities. and commercial in this region of the country. According to DANE, only 3.36% of the population has unsatisfied basic needs (DANE, 2018), which places it as one of the cities with the highest quality of life nationwide.4​ It has an estimated population of 132,894 inhabitants by 2024, according to DANE Census projections.

Its geographical location has consolidated it as one of the cities with the greatest projection in eastern Colombia. It is one of the three main urban centers in the Department of Boyacá, being a fundamental part of the Boyacá Industrial Corridor, the main economic area of ​​the Department. It presents a productive diversity, mainly with regard to educational, commercial, industrial, transportation and service activities, forming with Sogamoso and other municipalities in the Provinces of Tundama and Sugamuxi a de facto conurbation, with a population of more than 350,000 inhabitants. , with influence in large regions of the center, north and east of Boyacá. It is part of the historical and heritage axis where the Colombian war of independence was staged. Very close, approximately 8 kilometers, is the Pantano de Vargas, where one of the largest battles against the Spanish army took place, which is reflected in the historical traditions and cultural heritage of the region.5

The name Duitama means "tribute to me" in Muyskkubun (Muisca language). tributaries to the chiefs Onzaga, Soatá, Chitagoto, Susacón or Cabita, Icabuco, Lupachoque, Sátiva, Tutazá and Cerinza. The natives lived in huts, seeking the heights of the Indian plain, Tigua, today the hills of La Milagrosa, Cargua, La Tolosa, San José (La Alacranera) and Tocogua.


During the conquest there was an immense decrease in the population due to death in combat and the flight of others, after having been subjected to humiliating treatments. The abandonment of the fertile lands by the indigenous people attracted the immediate occupation of the conquerors, who began urban planning in accordance with the regulations issued by the Spanish crown.

Duitama was founded as an encomienda in 1539 and its encomendero was Baltazar Maldonado. After Baltazar's death, Duitama became a Corregimiento.

The first missionary educators who arrived in Duitama were those of the order of Santo Domingo, they consecrated the place as a doctrinal center until 1775, when it was erected as a Parish. Compulsory military service was established for the first time in Duitama, by order of the Liberator Simón Bolívar in 1819, the year in which Duitama was also established as a Municipality.

In the first half of the 20th century, Duitama strengthened as an eminently agricultural region and milling companies such as Molino Tundama were consolidated, followed by the Molinos del Sol and the Cóndor, as well as the Fábrica Bavaria.

These events, along with the arrival of the railroad in 1923 and the completion of the highway to Bogotá, marked an important point in the development of the local economy, thanks to the generation of employment that motivated the displacement of residents from the rural area and from other municipalities close to the city center, thus consolidating the urban area.

Starting in 1950, purely agricultural activity was modified by the productive-industrial occupation of the region in the so-called Boyacá industrial corridor. Factories and industries such as Paz del Río, Coca-Cola, Postobon-lux, Cementos Boyacá, Siderúrgica de Boyacá, Metalúrgica, Sofasa, Termopaipa, Mainz, and others, generated jobs and displacement of rural residents to the urban area of ​​the city.

In the eighties, the construction of the Industrial Citadel (Cooperative Industrial de Boyacá - CIDEB- Ltda.), classified as an Industrial Park by the Ministry of Economic Development, and the rapid growth of the transport union gained unusual importance in the economy of the municipality. This entire industrialization process led to the accelerated growth of the city and further configured Duitama's area of ​​influence.

Tundama (†1539) was a chief and lord of the Duitama territories. He was ruling at the time of the arrival of the Spanish and, although the other Muisca chiefs had surrendered in 1538, he put up fierce resistance to the Spanish.

He initially attacked Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada, who was nearly killed in Bonza when he returned from Sogamoso. While the rest of the Muiscas domains submitted and even the Panches, and Guanes; Tundama remained defiant. A year later, on December 15, 1539, he faced Captain Baltasar Maldonado in a battle, who had, in addition to his men, some 2,000 allied yaconas, in the swampy plains of Duitama. With about 10,000 soldiers he entrenched himself within his territories, which looked like islands, surrounded by small lagoons, this military fortress nullified the advantage of the Spanish cavalry.

He resisted for several days, losing more than 4,000 men and others deserted the battlefield. But still he held firm to his positions. The Spaniards were able to communicate directly with him and tried to intimidate him, but Tundama stated that he intended to kill them and their horses to make offerings to his wives. Several days later he was offered a peace treaty but he rejected it, reminding them that they had killed the Zipas and Zaques. He resisted for about 15 days and caused enormous casualties to the Spanish and their allies, until a cavalry charge finally destroyed one of his fortresses by opening a breach, the Spanish took Duitama and finally captured Tundama who was killed by hammer blows by the same captain

The first time that the Spanish heard of the chief Tundama was in 1537, having recently arrived in the Muisca lands of the Cundiboyacence Altiplano. Near the indigenous town of Iza, a group of Spaniards led by the future conqueror of the plains, Juan de San Martín met an old man who was missing a hand and had his ears cut off, earrings on either side of his neck. That punishment, he said, had been inflicted on him by Tundama himself for having dared to suggest that they surrender to the Spanish. Faced with the conquest, the Muiscas had several options. Some accepted the subjugation after the military defeat, like the men of Quemuenchatocha in Tunja or those of Tisquesusa in Zipaquirá. Others, like the Tunebos from the north of Boyacá, preferred death and chose to jump into the void from the Rock of the Dead, falling into the Nevado River. For Tundama, however, the only way out was war to the death. In the words of historian Javier Ocampo López, Tundama became early in the Conquest the “maximum hero of indigenous resistance in the New Kingdom of Granada.” The Tundama chief had a large area of ​​influence. Dozens of minor chiefs paid tribute to him, many of them with sonorous names such as Icabuco and Saquencipá, Sátiva and Socotá, Tibabita and Tibativa, Chitagote and Tocavita. To confront the Spanish he managed to gather an army of ten thousand men, according to the three great chroniclers of the Indies who narrate his fight: Juan de Castellanos, Brother Pedro Simón and Lucas Fernández de Piedrahíta.

The great battle, which could occupy the first place in number of victims among all those in the history of the city, occurred on December 15, 1539 in the Pantano de la Guerra, in the swampy plain that Duitama occupies today. When confronting the men of Captain Baltasar de Maldonado, future encomendero of Duitama, four thousand of Tundama's men died in combat, and many others were wounded. The Spaniards were only one hundred, forty of them on horseback, but they had the help of two thousand indigenous people -Yanaconas from Peru and other local ethnic groups- who had joined their cause. Tundama, who ran until the end of the battle among his troops to encourage them, was captured alive and executed with hammer blows by Maldonado himself. It was the end of the Muisca resistance. The 'Indian town' of Duitama, which was once the main seat of the Tundama chiefdom, does not have a formal founding document, which has always worried local politicians who have wanted a name day for their parades. To complete, Duitama was a secondary town throughout the Colony and almost a century of republican life. Duitama had only two notable events in colonial times. On the one hand, the Marquis of Surba y Bonza settled on its lands in 1789, one of the few Creole families that allegedly managed to acquire royal titles in Spain. On the other hand, in 1778 he visited the newly created parish of Duitama Don Francisco Moreno y Escandón, in what would be the only visit by any of the great authorities of the viceroyalty.

Independence
In the War of Independence Duitama did have more important roles. Next to the mansion of the Marquis Don Joaquín del Castillo, Bolívar's armies camped on the eve of the battle of Pantano de Vargas. And from the town of Duitama came many of the recruits from this battle and from that of Boyacá, recruits who, in the words of the British Legion officer Daniel O'Leary, to give them a martial air, you had to first remove their ruana, strip them of their hat. and shearing them, in addition to "instructing them in the use of the weapon and making them shoot without closing their eyes and turning their heads back, putting their own lives and those of their companions in greater danger than that of their opponents." The historical turning point in which Duitama began to become one of the great cities of the department came later, towards the first and second decades of the 20th century. During the five-year government of Rafael Reyes, born in the neighboring town of Santa Rosa de Viterbo, Duitama had a progressive, although somewhat dictatorial, mayor. His name was Tadeo Prieto, and he was President Reyes' uncle. One Sunday, the mayor had the public force close the road to Santa Rosa, where people used to go on market day, to force them to do their shopping in town. Prieto punished failure to comply with minor rules such as untidiness with prison; He himself was once imprisoned - they say - for falling into one of these minor penalties. In 1911, the Tundama Flour Industry was established in Duitama, whose building, now abandoned, should be a national monument. Its mills were powered by modern steam machinery and its siren, which signaled the workers' schedules, was for many years the public clock of Duitama. With the construction of the Northern Central Highway, inaugurated in 1928, Duitama was located at a crossroads and made public transportation another industrial emporium.

Duitama is located in the department of Boyacá, belongs to the Andean geographical region and is located in the Boyacense highlands, between the channels of the Chiticuy river and the Surba river. Duitama is the capital of the Tundama province and is located on the Boyacá industrial corridor (See Map1).

The city is surrounded and crossed from south to north by the hills of Milagrosa or Calvario, San José Alto, Alacranera or Tavor, Tolosa, Cargua, Tocogua, Pan de Azúcar, Cerro del Nevado, Alto del Tigre and Mount Rusio (better known as the Russian Wasteland). The previous geographical features are all belonging to the foothills of the eastern mountain range.

Among its main orographic points, the Pan de Azúcar moorland and the La Russia moorland stand out with heights that exceed 3,800 m asl. Equally noteworthy are the Cuchilla de Laguna Seca (sector where the radio antennas are located), the Morro de la Russia (where the transmission towers and antennas are located), Cerro de Pan de Azúcar, Morro de La Cruz, Morro de Peña Blanca and Peña Negra blade (where the Military Base is located).

Extension
According to updated information from the Agustín Codazzi Geographic Institute, Duitama has a total area of ​​267,042 km², of which 3.29% (8,861km) correspond to urban areas and 96.6% (258,180) correspond to rural areas.

Topography

Duitama landscape.
Duitama is located in the Alto Chicamocha Valley in the Altiplano Cundiboyacense region, on the Eastern Cordillera of the Andes in the center of the country. In the urban area, the tutelary hills of La Milagrosa, La Tolosa and San José (La Alacranera), Cerro Las Lajas and perimeter hills such as Cerro Las Cruces and Cerro Cargua are identified.

In the Jurisdiction of the Municipality of Duitama, there is located an area of ​​paramo ecosystem made up of Pan de Azúcar and Russia. This paramo ecosystem of the Andes mountain system gives rise to an exceptional hydrographic star, feeding the rivers that bathe regions corresponding to the departments of Boyacá and Santander. Duitama has 12,000 hectares of moor which correspond to 50% of the territory represented in the Russia and Sugar Loaf moors.

The biological resources of the two moors host in their territory the three existing genera of Frailejón, namely: Espeletia, Espeletiopsis, Paramiflos; with a total of 11 referenced species, some of them endemic, among the 38 identified for the eastern mountain range. Tree elements such as palms and ferns are reported to be very abundant. A great diversity of bromeliads, orchids, lichens and mosses are included.

Duitama stands out for the modernity of its buildings.
Hydrography
The water resources of the rivers and streams: In an abrupt and broken topography, deep valleys are represented dissected by a large number of drainages where the Chontal rivers, the Russia, Surba, Chiticuy and numerous streams that feed the dry slope of the Chicamocha River originate. .

Lagoons: Cachalu, Agua Clara, Pan de Azúcar and Las Cruces stand out. They are complemented by Corralitos lagoon, Juncal, Aracoba, Peña Negra, Chochal, los Cuadros, Pozo Negro and numerous wetlands.
Wetlands: They function in the moor as minor ecological systems and constitute the most threatened ecological ecosystem in the area due to sheep and livestock activities. Some fish and moor ducks typical of this habitat have lost their space, due to the food competition generated from the introduction of trout, to which is added the anthropic activity (hunting, misuse of water and soil) exerted on these ecosystems. .

The precipitation that occurs in the area is that corresponding to the isohyet curve 1,200 meters above sea level and 1,560 meters above sea level.

According to the Köppen classification, Duitama has a Cfb type climate: high mountain oceanic. Like all regions of the Intertropical Zone, the climate is influenced only by altitude and ocean currents that cause slight variations in temperature, the most significant between day and night as can be seen in the following table.

The average temperature is 15 °C, however, the city in a single day can reach from 5 to 24 °C, the average precipitation is 1,128 mm, the rainy periods statistically correspond to the months of March to May and from September to November, and the dry season mainly corresponds to the months of June to August and December to February; the relative humidity is 81.4% average; evaporation covers a range between 80.63 mm and 99.53 mm; The predominant winds come from the southeast and south, the average speed is 2.86 and 3.29 m/s, the winds are stronger in July and August; Insolation or sunshine corresponds to an average of 5 hours per day and 1,820 annual hours of sunshine.
Flora and fauna
Flora classes:

Onion cultivation in the south of Duitama, Boyacá, Colombia.
- Native flora: or autonomous flora of an area is a classification that is based on the predominant trees in a more or less determined area. It is considered that the flora of the moors has had a double origin. On the one hand, there are the extratropical elements, both southern and boreal, pre-adapted to low temperatures and, on the other, there are the elements of tropical origin originating in the mesothermal floors of the tropical mid-mountain, adapted to low temperatures. In Duitama you can find various plant species such as: Fique, Aliso, Salvia, Tuna or penco, Cortadera, Caña brava, Junco, Sietecueros, Mortiño, Zarzamora, Cerezo.


Hemlock flowers in a rural area of ​​Duitama
- Agricultural and garden flora: The plants that are cultivated by humans are the agricultural and garden flora, which is that in which the plants that are cared for and cultivated by human beings develop. Duitama is characterized by fruit crops such as apples, peaches, pears, curubas and plums; also vegetables such as potatoes, wheat, corn, beans, barley and vegetables.

- Weed flora or weeds: Plants known as weeds are those that grow wild and whose presence in some way affects human activities such as agriculture and gardening. In Duitama most of the weeds are introduced plants, although it is possible to find some native plants acting as weeds.9​10​

Introduced weeds: They represent most of the weeds in Duitama, some of these are:
Hemlock (Conium maculatum), is quite common in pastures and rural areas, it is highly toxic and poisoning occurs when ingested when it is confused with parsley or cilantro.
Stramonium (Datura stramonium), toxic plant common in rural areas and some pastures.
Castor plant (Ricinus communis), is a shrub usually 2 - 3 m high, sometimes more, it usually grows mostly in rural areas next to roads or streams. Its seeds contain one of the most powerful biological toxins.
Canary seed (Sinapis alba or Brassica rapa), are common herbs in rural areas, especially in onion crops. They are known as canary seed because their seeds are frequently used as food for birds. Farmers usually collect them to sell them in the market place. .
Golden Ball (Solanum marginatum), a shrub with thorns that usually grows in pastures.
Thistles (Cirsium vulgare and Silybum marianum) are two species characteristic of pastures and rural areas, the most common is C. vulagare.
Wolftail (Orobanche minor), is a parasitic herb that mainly affects the legume family, in Duitama it flowers in October-December.
Clovers (Trifolium pratense, Trifolium repens, Medicago lupulina) These species known as clovers or clovers are introduced herbs that usually affect gardening.
Weeds (Sonchus asper and Sonchus oleraceus) are considered one of the worst weeds in gardening because they are difficult to eradicate.
Others are dandelions (Hypochaeris radicala and Taraxacum officinale), soapwort (Lysimachia arvensis), milkweed (Euphorbia peplus), white melilotus (Melilotus albus), shepherd's needle (Erodium moschatum), cotula (Cotula australis), etc.
Native weeds: Few native plants are considered weeds, some are: toasted corn (Lepidium bipinnatifidum), sanalotodo (Modiola caroliniana), juamparao (Conyza), sour clovers (Oxalis latifolia, Oxalis corniculata and Oxalis spiralis), matapalo (Dendrophthora clavata).
Fauna classes:
- Wild fauna: The native flora of an area: refers to all plants, animals and other non-domesticated organisms, that is, those that live without human intervention for their development or nutrition. It is made up of all the animals that naturally belong to the environment they inhabit.

- Domestic fauna: Domestic fauna, or fauna subject to Domestication, is made up of the domestic species themselves, that is, those species subject to the domination of man, which become accustomed to living under this domination without the need to be enclosed or subject and that in this state reproduce indefinitely, with this domain as the objective of exploiting the capacity of various animals to produce work, meat, wool, skins, feathers, eggs, companionship and other products and services (the horse, the ox, the sheep , the goat, the cat, the dog, the chicken, the pig).

- Aquatic fauna: Aquatic animals and amphibians contribute to animate the environment and each play a specific role to build and maintain the balance of the ecosystem that occurs in rivers, lagoons, streams and lakes, like trout, these types are quite difficult to store since they are very delicate fish. They are fish that always need cold water, so they are mainly suitable for artificial lakes. Furthermore, these fish are ferocious and not very attractive, as there is little variety of types and colors. In the main lakes, lagoons, rivers, and streams of Duitama, we can find species such as common trout, rainbows, toads, algae, worms, ducks, tadpoles, crabs, among others.


Melinis minutiflora in Duitama
- Invasive Flora and Fauna An invasive species is an introduced (non-native) species that becomes problematic. In Duitama it is possible to find several of these species.

According to the Humboldt Institute, there are a large number of invasive species in Colombia, some of which have been reported in Duitama.11 This is the case of:
Domestic pigeon (Columba livia), found mainly in the Plaza de los Libertadores and other parks. They transmit diseases and often cause damage to structures such as statues and buildings with their excrement.
Common Snail (Helix aspersa), causes damage mainly to agriculture and gardening. It is also used as food for ducks.
Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) causes damage to aquatic ecosystems by competing with native fish species. An example of its negative impact in Boyacá is the extinction of the Tota Fatty Fish (Rhizosomichthys totae).
River lobster (Procambarus clarkii) can affect some crops and can also carry pathogens.
Rats and Mice (Rattus rattus and Mus musculus respectively) due to their ease of transmitting diseases are a public health risk.

Thunbergia alata in Duitama
For flora, National Parks12​ and the Humedales Foundation13​ take these species into account:
The poet's eye (Thunbergia alata), this vine has the ability to colonize areas very easily, sometimes it can cover a tree completely, causing its death.
The thorny broom (Ulex europaeus), this species can colonize large areas and due to the difficulty of eradication, it is a threat to native ecosystems such as the moor.
Yaragua (Melinis minutiflora) is a species of grass that can spread quickly competing with the native flora, it can be found on the Raizal trail.
Buchón (Eichornia crassipes), although in Duitama its impact has not been as great compared to other municipalities, this species can easily colonize a body of water, covering it almost completely, causing the body of water to dry out.
Other species that are not mentioned and that have invasive potential in Duitama are: eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus), kalanchoe (Kalanchoe densiflora), and different acacias (Acacia melanoxylon and Acacia mearnsii).

The population of the municipality of Duitama, over time, has had an important evolution in its degree of urbanization: while the 1985 census reported that 77% of the population resided in the urban area, the 2005 census reported 87% of the population resides in this area, with a projection for 2015 that amounts to 95%.

The industrialization process, economic development in cities and the search for better living conditions has led to significant growth in urban centers.

Under this dynamic, the health sector must be prepared to face the impact of urban expansion on the health-disease process, taking into account the relationship between health and the place where one lives. The evolution of the city leads to problems such as exposure to noise, high episodes of pollution, restricted availability of drinking water and lack of open spaces. These conditions can have negative impacts on health if adequate urban planning systems are not available. management of health measures at the municipal level14
